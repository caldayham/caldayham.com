      "date": "2025-10-28",
      "excerpt": "If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Browser extensions like Pie and Honey don't block ads to help youâ€”they track your data to help advertisers target you better. Here's why YouTube promotes one 'ad blocker' while banning others, and what that tells you about the incentive structure.",

      "date": "2025-10-28",
      "excerpt": "If you don't write a review after purchasing something, the market becomes extremely one-sided. Either only angry customers share their experiences, skewing perception negatively, or only the business controls the narrative, skewing it positively.
