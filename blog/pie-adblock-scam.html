                <h2>Pie Adblock Scam (And Why YouTube Promotes It)</h2>
                <p class="subtitle">October 28, 2025</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>I keep seeing ads for this app called Pie—some browser extension that supposedly blocks ads and pays
                    you to watch them. It's being pushed hard on YouTube, even by people affiliated with the platform.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    In the back of your mind, you're obviously thinking: this sounds like either a scam or there's
                    something non-obvious going on here. Why would YouTube promote a tool that blocks their main revenue
                    source? And why is this extension allowed when real ad blockers get banned?</p>

                <h3>Google's Business Model (In 60 Seconds)</h3>
                <p>Google's business model is stupidly profitable. They buy a bunch of computers, connect them worldwide
                    with infrastructure, and use those computers to organize data flowing between everyone else's
                    computers. Then they look at that data and say: "Hey, Company XYZ sells shoes. We know these people
                    look at shoes online. We'll sell you moments of their attention where you can pitch your shoes."</p>

                <p>An ad placement slot doesn't physically exist. It's just bits on a computer somewhere. The reason
                    this is such a good business is because there can really only be one giant company controlling all
                    this infrastructure. If Amazon was only accessible through Bing and all your friends used Bing,
                    you'd switch to Bing. But nobody's leaving Google, so they can jack prices up to maximize profit.
                </p>

                <p>The key thing you got to remember: Google only gets one or two ad slots in front of you per video.
                    They've increased it from one ad to two or maybe three, but they don't get many shots. They want to
                    put the ad there that's actually going to sell.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Why Wasted Ads Are Expensive</h3>
                <p>If you're a 15-year-old boy and you get an ad for tampons, everyone loses. The tampon company wasted
                    money. Google wasted money because they wasted a slot they could have sold for more. You wasted
                    time. It's a waste all around.</p>

                <p>If Google knows you're a 15-year-old boy, they're going to red flag all those tampon ads—anything
                    you're not going to buy. That's why they ask you "Does this ad seem interesting to you?" It's
                    actually more profitable in that moment for them to ask for your opinion than it is to show you
                    another ad. They're not being nice—they're maximizing profit by gathering data.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>The Honey Comparison</h3>
                <p>This is the same reason Honey exists. People are like "Why do you save money when you just
                    download this browser extension?" The reason is it tracks all of your data.</p>

                <p>Instead of getting a little bit of data from a few sites that have opted into Google's ad sharing
                    program, you're constantly getting tracked on every site you visit. All that data gets added to your
                    profile. My ads are actually pretty good at this point—I watch ads and think "damn, I kind of want
                    that." Sometimes I do buy it, because it's genuinely a good product that's relevant to me.</p>

                <p>I'm not saying advertising is bad. You need to be able to tell people about your products. I'm just
                    trying to illuminate what's actually happening here.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>So What's Pie Actually Doing?</h3>
                <p>My thought is that Pie—and I'm like 99.9% sure about this, but drop it in the comments if I'm
                    wrong—is simply another way for companies like Google to have more data on you. More targeted ads.
                    More money.</p>

                <p>If Google knows exactly what type of product you're looking for, all the features you care about, and
                    all your preferences, they can sell that certainty to advertisers. Say you're in the market for a 3D
                    printer. There's a company selling high-margin 3D printers making $300 profit per unit. If Google
                    puts the perfect ad in front of you and you click and buy, that company made $100 profit. They could
                    pay $20 to Google for that customer acquisition—which is steep, but they still made $80.</p>

                <p>The best part for Google? They don't even need to communicate the certainty directly. If they put
                    that ad in front of you and you buy, they just charge per customer acquired. The advertiser is fine
                    with paying because they made money. Google is happy because they maximized the value of that ad
                    slot.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Why YouTube Bans Real Ad Blockers But Promotes Pie</h3>
                <p>Real ad blockers actually block cookies and HTTP traffic from flagged ad sites. They genuinely
                    prevent Google from serving ads and collecting data. Those get banned because they hurt Google's
                    business model.</p>

                <p>Pie doesn't hurt Google's business model—it enhances it. You think you're blocking ads and getting
                    paid, but what you're actually doing is giving Google (and other advertisers) way more data about
                    your browsing behavior. That data makes their ad targeting more effective, which means they can
                    charge advertisers more money for those slots.</p>

                <p>The fact that YouTube actively promotes Pie while banning other ad blockers tells you everything you
                    need to know about whose interests are being served.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>The Pattern to Notice</h3>
                <p>Anytime something seems like it's being done for you—like "oh this is great, you should definitely do
                    this"—there is likely some ulterior motive. Educate yourself more. Constantly try to learn and think
                    about what is in front of you and why.</p>

                <p>If a service seems too good to be true, ask yourself: what's the incentive structure? Who profits?
                    What data am I giving up? What am I getting in return?</p>

                <p>In this case, you're getting a few cents to watch ads you might have watched anyway. In exchange,
                    you're giving comprehensive browsing data that makes you a much more valuable advertising target.
                    The math works out great—for Google and advertisers. For you? Well, that depends on how much you
                    value your privacy and browsing data.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>What To Do About It</h3>
                <p>I'm not telling you to delete Pie or Honey or whatever browser extensions you use. I'm just
                    illuminating what's actually happening so you can make an informed decision.</p>

                <p>If you're fine with the tradeoff—sharing comprehensive data in exchange for small payments or
                    discount codes—that's a legitimate choice. Just make it consciously, knowing what you're trading.
                </p>

                <p>But don't fool yourself into thinking these companies are doing you a favor out of the goodness of
                    their hearts. They're doing it because the data you provide is worth more to them than the money
                    they're paying you. That's how the business model works.</p>

                <p>The pieces add up once you understand the incentive structure. And once you see this pattern, you'll
                    start noticing it everywhere.</p>
