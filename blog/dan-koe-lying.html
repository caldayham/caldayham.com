                <p>There are millions of people trying to sell information online because information has
                    no physical volume, but it does have real value.
                    It makes the perfect product online.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    What no one wants to tell you is that the best package of information to sell online is how to sell
                    information online.
                    The higher you go up this meta-ladder, the more you can charge, and the better your margins get.
                    It's not exactly a pyramid scheme, but it shares quite a few attributes ;)

                <h3>The Promise</h3>
                <p>Here's the standard pitch: Get good at social media. Get good at marketing. Understand how people
                    think. Create a valuable product. Match that product to your market. Build an audience around your
                    niche, create a product around your passion, and make money. Simple, right?</p>

                <p>The implication is straightforward: you're going to build this audience, take the thing you love,
                    make a product around it, and earn as much as the people teaching you. But there's a catch that
                    nobody mentions upfront.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>The Pyramid Reality</h3>
                <p>The best products to actually make that kind of money aren't products about your random passion.
                    They're products teaching people how to make products. And it gets better: teaching people how to
                    make courses on how to make courses on how to make courses. Each layer up, you can charge more.</p>

                <p>Why? Because someone selling a course can afford to pay more for education than someone just learning
                    a regular skill. A course about writing as a business model can reasonably charge $150 because
                    you're selling a business framework, not just writing tips. But try charging $150 for a course on
                    supplement optimization or woodworking basics. Your market shrinks dramatically because those buyers
                    aren't planning to turn around and sell their own courses.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Twitter and the Race</h3>
                <p>Scroll through Twitter and you'll see countless bios: "I scaled 4 people to 10,000 followers and I
                    can do the same for you." Click on any profile in this space and you'll find variations of the same
                    thing: selling digital products on how to sell digital products. SMM courses. Creator economy
                    courses. Audience building courses. All roads lead to the same destination.</p>

                <p>It starts to look like a race to the bottom, or maybe a race to the top of the pyramid. Use fancy
                    tools to promote fancy courses to grow really fast so you can sell courses on how to sell courses.
                    The system feeds itself.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>The Lower Rungs</h3>
                <p>Let's say you actually care about something tangible. Physical health, for example. You research
                    supplements extensively. You could probably deliver one-fifth the value of an hour with the world's
                    best supplement expert. People might pay $100-200 for that information if it's genuinely useful and
                    saves them time.</p>

                <p>But here's the problem: you can't charge $150 for that course, because it's not teaching someone how
                    to start a business that will make them enough money to buy more courses. You're stuck on a lower
                    rung. Your market is people who want to optimize their health, not people who want to build a
                    course-selling business.</p>

                <p>The math works differently at different levels. To make money selling practical skills, you need
                    volume. To make money selling business frameworks, you need far fewer customers at higher price
                    points. And to make money selling frameworks about selling frameworks? Now you're playing a
                    different game entirely.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>The Nuance Nobody Mentions</h3>
                <p>The title of this article strips away nuance by design, just like the content it critiques. Dan Koe
                    isn't lying in the traditional sense. The Two-Hour Writer is a solid product. Justin Welsh writes
                    absolutely killer Twitter threads that are genuinely useful. These people are skilled at what they
                    do.</p>

                <p>But there's an implication in the creator economy content that's technically true but missing
                    context: "You are the niche. Build an audience around that niche. Create a product. Sell it." The
                    unspoken part is that the most lucrative version of this formula is when your niche is teaching
                    other people to do exactly what you're doing.</p>

                <p>It's not wrong. It's just that the stack goes up further than most people realize, and the people at
                    the top have a vested interest in selling shovels during a gold rush without explicitly saying "the
                    real gold is in selling shovels."</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Where Does This Leave You?</h3>
                <p>If you're on a lower rung selling actual skills or products, you're not doomed. You're just playing a
                    different game with different economics. You might need more customers, better margins through
                    unique expertise, or a different path to scale. But you're probably not going to make creator
                    economy money selling supplement advice or woodworking tips.</p>

                <p>If you're climbing the meta-ladder, understand what you're doing. Each level up gets you access to
                    customers with more purchasing power because they're using your product as a tool to make money, not
                    just to improve their lives. There's nothing inherently wrong with this, but it's worth
                    acknowledging the structure openly.</p>

                <p>The real question isn't whether this is a pyramid scheme (it's not, technically). The real question
                    is which game you want to play and whether you're being honest with yourself about which game you're
                    actually playing.</p>
