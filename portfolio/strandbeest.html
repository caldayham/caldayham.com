            <h2>Operational Strandbeest Sculpture</h2>

            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Kinetic Sculpture & Metal Fabrication</p>
                <p><strong>Scale:</strong> Medium-sized, rideable sculpture</p>
                <p><strong>Construction:</strong> 500+ pieces, 2,000+ welds</p>
                <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Welding, Metal Fabrication, Kinetic Design</p>
                <p><strong>Inspiration:</strong> Theo Jansen's Strandbeest designs</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Built a medium-sized operational kinetic sculpture inspired by Dutch artist Theo Jansen's famous Strandbeest (beach beast) designs. The sculpture was constructed from over 500 individual pieces of cold drawn and flat steel, assembled with over 2,000 welds. The final result is fully functional and rideable, demonstrating complex mechanical motion through elegant linkage systems.</p>

            <h3>About Strandbeests</h3>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>Strandbeests are wind-powered kinetic sculptures created by Dutch artist Theo Jansen. These "beach animals" walk on their own using ingeniously designed leg mechanisms that convert rotational motion into remarkably lifelike walking gaits. Jansen's leg linkage design has become iconic in the kinetic sculpture world for its efficiency and organic movement.</p>
            </div>

        <section>
            <h3>Design & Leg Mechanism</h3>
            <p>The leg mechanism is the heart of any strandbeest design. Rather than attempting to reinvent Jansen's brilliant engineering, I used his proven leg linkage dimensions as the foundation, focusing my innovation on scaling, structural integrity, and making it rideable.</p>

            <h4>Jansen's Leg Linkage</h4>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>Theo Jansen spent years refining the perfect leg mechanism through evolutionary algorithms. His "holy numbers" create a specific relationship between 11 leg segments that produces smooth, efficient walking motion. This mechanism converts simple rotational input into complex, lifelike leg movement.</p>
            </div>

            <p>My contribution was scaling these proportions for a larger, rideable structure and engineering the entire supporting framework to handle human weight while maintaining smooth operation.</p>

            <h3>Construction Process</h3>
            <p>Building this kinetic sculpture was an intensive week-long project involving hundreds of hours of cutting, fitting, and welding:</p>

            <h4>Materials & Scale</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Materials:</strong> Cold drawn steel bar and flat steel stock</li>
                <li><strong>Individual Pieces:</strong> Over 500 cut and shaped components</li>
                <li><strong>Welds:</strong> Over 2,000 individual weld joints</li>
                <li><strong>Size:</strong> Medium scale - large enough to ride</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Fabrication Stages</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Planning:</strong> Calculated scaled dimensions for leg mechanisms and supporting structure</li>
                <li><strong>Cutting:</strong> Cut hundreds of steel pieces to precise lengths and angles</li>
                <li><strong>Leg Assembly:</strong> Built multiple leg mechanisms following Jansen's linkage geometry</li>
                <li><strong>Frame Construction:</strong> Welded main structural frame to support legs and rider</li>
                <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Connected all components and drive system</li>
                <li><strong>Testing & Refinement:</strong> Adjusted clearances and reinforced stressed joints</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>Scaling Up:</strong> Jansen's original designs are optimized for lightweight beach operation. Scaling to rideable size while maintaining smooth motion required careful attention to joint tolerances and structural reinforcement.</p>
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Structural Integrity:</strong> Ensuring welds and joints could handle dynamic loads from walking motion plus rider weight</li>
                <li><strong>Joint Precision:</strong> Maintaining correct linkage geometry across 500+ pieces and 2,000+ welds</li>
                <li><strong>Balance:</strong> Distributing weight appropriately for stable walking motion</li>
                <li><strong>Drive System:</strong> Creating a practical method to power the walking mechanism</li>
                <li><strong>Clearances:</strong> Preventing interference between moving leg components</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>The Build Timeline</h3>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>The entire project was completed in approximately one week of intensive work, though this involved some very late nights and early mornings. The compressed timeline required careful planning and sustained focus throughout the fabrication process.</p>
            </div>

            <p>This rapid turnaround was possible due to having a clear vision, proper materials on hand, and previous welding and fabrication experience. Each day built upon the previous day's progress, with leg mechanisms coming together first, followed by the main frame, and finally integration and testing.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>The Result: A Rideable Kinetic Sculpture</h3>
            <p>The completed strandbeest successfully demonstrates:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Smooth, organic walking motion using mechanical linkages</li>
                <li>Structural capability to support a human rider</li>
