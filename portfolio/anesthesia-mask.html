            <h2>Non-Stereotaxic Rodent Anesthesia Mask</h2>

            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Product Design & B2B Business</p>
                <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 2020-2023</p>
                <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> SolidWorks CAD, SLA & FDM 3D Printing, B2B Sales & Marketing</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Over 2,400 mice and rats have been anesthetized with this non-stereotaxic mask I designed during my time at the University of Minnesota. What started as a solution for my own lab became a small B2B business serving research labs across the United States.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>Replacing old lab equipment is expensive, and existing rodent anesthesia masks on the market often lack key features that researchers need. Labs typically buy whatever masks are bundled with their higher-ticket anesthesia systems, even when those masks aren't optimal for their research needs.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>I designed a non-stereotaxic rodent anesthesia mask with several key improvements over existing products. The design was simple but effective, addressing specific pain points that other masks in this niche missed.</p>
            <p>Using SolidWorks for CAD and a combination of SLA and FDM 3D printing, I could manufacture these masks at a fraction of the cost of commercial alternatives while maintaining high quality and functionality.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Building the Business</h3>
            <p>The mask was a hit with local labs at the University of Minnesota, which led me to explore selling it independently. I built out an offer and started doing warm email outreach to research institutions.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>Lead Generation Strategy:</strong> I collected thousands of emails from the listed-contacts section of papers published around rodent research that involved anesthesia. This turned out to be an amazingly effective way of getting qualified leads - researchers who were already doing work that required exactly this type of equipment.</p>
            </div>

            <p>The mask was effective when integrated into labs, but there was significant friction in the buying process for such a relatively low-ticket item. Often these labs would default to buying masks sold with their existing anesthesia systems, even if those masks weren't as effective.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Outcome & Lessons Learned</h3>
            <p>I eventually shut down the business, but the hundreds of intricate little rodent anesthesia masks I made will be used as needed in labs across the states for the next few decades.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> For anyone thinking about selling their own B2B physical product, it's likely a better idea to start working at a larger established company to gain experience. You'll have access to their existing client base and production facilities, so you can learn what works more quickly before branching off and doing your own thing.</p>
            </div>

            <p>This project taught me invaluable lessons about product development, B2B marketing, lead generation, various forms of 3D printing, and the realities of selling low-ticket items in specialized markets.</p>
