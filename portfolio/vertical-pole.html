            <h2>Vertical Pole Evolution - Stroke Behavioral Test</h2>

            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Research Equipment Design & Fabrication</p>
                <p><strong>Institution:</strong> Department of Neurosurgery, University of Minnesota Medical School</p>
                <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 2021-2022</p>
                <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> SolidWorks, Custom Fabrication, Research Methodology</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Designed and built multiple iterations of behavioral testing equipment for neurological deficit assessment in rats following ischemic stroke. This custom equipment enabled more accurate measurement of treatment effectiveness in stroke research at the Department of Neurosurgery, University of Minnesota.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>The Research Problem</h3>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>When researching stroke treatments, scientists need reliable ways to measure neurological function in animal models. The vertical pole test is a validated method for assessing motor coordination and neurological deficit after stroke, but existing equipment often lacks the precision needed for nuanced measurements.</p>
            </div>

            <p>The vertical pole test challenges rats to descend a vertical pole head-first, requiring coordination, balance, and motor planning - abilities that are impaired by stroke. By measuring how rats perform this task, researchers can quantify the severity of stroke damage and the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Design Evolution</h3>
            <p>Rather than accepting off-the-shelf solutions, I designed and built multiple iterations of the test apparatus, progressively improving functionality and measurement precision:</p>

            <h4>Iterative Design Process</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Analyzed requirements from research protocols and existing limitations</li>
                <li>Created CAD models in SolidWorks for each design iteration</li>
                <li>Fabricated prototypes using available materials and lab equipment</li>
                <li>Tested with research team and collected feedback</li>
                <li>Refined designs based on usability and measurement accuracy</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Key Design Features</h3>
            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>Adjustability:</strong> Variable pole heights and diameters to accommodate different experimental protocols and rat sizes</p>
                <p><strong>Stability:</strong> Secure mounting preventing movement during testing</p>
                <p><strong>Measurement Integration:</strong> Design facilitated video recording and timing measurements</p>
                <p><strong>Animal Welfare:</strong> Incorporated safe landing zones and appropriate surface textures</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Research Applications</h3>
            <p>The custom vertical pole apparatus was used to assess:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Motor coordination deficits post-stroke</li>
                <li>Neurological recovery over time</li>
                <li>Effectiveness of experimental stroke treatments</li>
                <li>Behavioral phenotypes in stroke models</li>
            </ul>

            <p>By providing reliable, consistent measurements, the equipment enabled more robust statistical analysis and better experimental reproducibility.</p>

            <h3>Technical Approach</h3>
            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>CAD Design:</strong> Used SolidWorks to model apparatus components with precise dimensions and tolerances</p>
                <p><strong>Material Selection:</strong> Chose materials appropriate for animal testing environments (cleanable, non-toxic, durable)</p>
                <p><strong>Custom Fabrication:</strong> Built equipment using lab workshop tools and fabrication techniques</p>
                <p><strong>Iterative Refinement:</strong> Continuously improved design based on researcher feedback and testing results</p>
