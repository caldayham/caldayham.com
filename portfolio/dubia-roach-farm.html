            <h2>Dubia Roach Farm - Commercial Scale Breeding Operation</h2>

            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Commercial Animal Breeding & Small Business</p>
                <p><strong>Scale:</strong> ~40,000 roaches in 1.5m x 1.5m incubated system</p>
                <p><strong>Species:</strong> <em>Blaptica dubia</em> (Dubia Roach)</p>
                <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Animal Husbandry, Environmental Control Systems, Small Business Operations</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Designed, built, and operated a commercial-scale Dubia roach breeding facility. The operation involved maintaining a colony of approximately 40,000 <em>Blaptica dubia</em> cockroaches in a custom-built 1.5-meter by 1.5-meter incubated breeding system. Roaches were bred and sold to pet stores as premium feeder insects for amphibians, reptiles, and other exotic pets.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Why Dubia Roaches?</h3>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>Dubia roaches have become the preferred feeder insect for reptile and amphibian keepers because they offer significant advantages over traditional crickets:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Higher protein content and better calcium-to-phosphorus ratio</li>
                    <li><strong>Longer Lifespan:</strong> Live longer than crickets, reducing die-off in customer care</li>
                    <li><strong>Low Maintenance:</strong> Don't chirp, don't smell, and don't jump or fly</li>
                    <li><strong>Soft Exoskeleton:</strong> Easier to digest for reptiles and amphibians</li>
                    <li><strong>Hardy:</strong> More resilient during shipping and storage</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>System Design</h3>
            <p>Built a custom breeding enclosure with carefully controlled environmental parameters:</p>

            <h4>Physical Infrastructure</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 1.5m x 1.5m footprint with vertical egg crate stacking</li>

                <li><strong>Housing:</strong> Egg crate material providing maximum surface area for the colony</li>
                <li><strong>Substrate:</strong> Minimal substrate system for easy cleaning and maintenance</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Environmental Controls</h4>
            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>Temperature Regulation:</strong> Maintained optimal breeding temperature (85-95°F) using custom heating elements</p>
                <p><strong>Humidity Control:</strong> Balanced humidity levels (40-60%) for healthy molting and growth</p>
                <p><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Adequate airflow to prevent mold and maintain air quality</p>
                <p><strong>Light Cycle:</strong> Controlled day/night cycle to support natural behaviors</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Breeding & Lifecycle Management</h3>
            <p>Successfully managed the complete lifecycle of a large-scale roach colony:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Breeding Stock:</strong> Maintained healthy adult breeding population</li>
                <li><strong>Nymph Development:</strong> Optimized conditions for rapid nymph growth</li>
                <li><strong>Population Control:</strong> Harvested roaches at appropriate sizes for different pet species</li>
                <li><strong>Nutrition Management:</strong> Fed colony high-quality diet to ensure nutritious end product</li>
                <li><strong>Health Monitoring:</strong> Regular colony health checks and parasite prevention</li>
            </ul>
